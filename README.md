# IA_flappy_bird

The project goal is to learn how to use git/github and try to understand NEAT (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) in python.
In the same time, i'll create my first game and AI.

I stocked my sprite in imgs
flappy_bird.py is where i coded the game and AI.
config_feedforward.txt is the configuration folder for NEAT
